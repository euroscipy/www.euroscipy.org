The EuroSciPy conference benefits from a diverse community, which has grown
as a friendly, welcoming and dynamic group.

We trust that attendees will behave towards each other in a way that
reflects the view widely shared by this community, that diversity and
civility are strengths to be celebrated and fostered.

Furthermore, we believe that the conference will be more productive and
enjoyable for everyone if a professional atmosphere prevails, meaning
that all delegates may expect to

- be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
- be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or bullying;
- enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.

If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact a
EuroSciPy organiser directly or send an email to [info@euroscipy.org](mailto:info@euroscipy.org).
Any complaint will remain confidential and will be investigated. The EuroSciPy
organisers will do their best to resolve any conflict and preserve the
welcoming character of the conference. As a last resort, a participant
may be requested to leave the venue of the conference, without
reimbursment.

The members of the code of conduct workgroup are:

- Darya Chyzhyk
- Alexandre Manhaes Savio

Furthermore, participants are hereby reminded that they should abide by
the laws of the country hosting EuroSciPy, with discrimination and
harassment being against the law. Cases of law-breaking actions shall be
reported to the police.
